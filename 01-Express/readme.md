# Scotch.io Intro to Node and Mongo

## 01-Express

This example shows how to create an Express server for Node.js. Data is retrieved from a local static file and new data `POST`ed to the server is saved in-memory. This is deliberate as the demonstration focuses on how to use Express.

### Installation and Running the App

Make sure `nodemon` is installed globally:

```
npm install -g nodemon
```

Clone the repo, then:

```
npm run dev
```

The app will be served at `localhost:3000`.
